 # Linear Search
 * <b >Linear Search</b> is defined as a sequential search algorithm that starts at one end and goes through each element of a list until the desired

 * Worst-case complexity is <b>O(n)</b>
 ***
 # Largest in Array
 1. -∞ --> Integer.MIN_VALUE;  
 1. +∞ --> Integer.MAX_VALUE;
 * Both are already present in java.util.* package;
 * For finding largest value we use -∞ so that we can compare the smallest value with another value to find the largest.
